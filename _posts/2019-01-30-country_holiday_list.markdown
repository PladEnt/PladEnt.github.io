  In my gem country holiday list, you can type ‘list’ to get a list of all the countries that my gem will support.
	
list=> a list of country’s names and codes

if you type a country’s code or name you will get.

US=> the code, name, and all the holidays in that country

The gem is command line based and explains itself to you, and is easy to understand.  you can find you gem on my GitHub page: https://github.com/PladEnt
