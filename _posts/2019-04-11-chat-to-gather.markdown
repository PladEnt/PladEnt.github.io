In my app I tried to make a social website where people could gather, organize events, and talk with each other. While developing Gathering (which is the name of my website) I ran into a lot of errors. I learned that you need to plan your program completely out before you begin. and that you need to know how to undo your migrations, because I know I made a lot of mistakes with my database.  But you need to stay motivated and don’t bit off more than you can chow, start small and get that working then add to what you’ve got.
