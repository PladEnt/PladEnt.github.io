  I started coding in Python when I was about sixteen years old as an elective on The Great Curses. I’ve suffered with dyslexia, and coding just clicked in the way I think. After the Great Curses, I just learned what I could online teaching myself. When I graduated, I did not know where I’d go from there, then I found The Flatiron School. Since then, I’ve learned the basics of several different coding languages, but I think that out of the languages I have learned so far, Ruby is my favorite. Ruby, with it's easy to remember commands and error codes, it the most fun for me to code in, and the fastest to learn. I can’t what to see where I will go from here, and what I’ll learn next.
